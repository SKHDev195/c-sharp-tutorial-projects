# Slava Ukraini!

# What Does This Application Do?

This application is an aggregator of trusted fundraisers raising money in support of Ukrainian people. 

It is designed to encourage donations to fund that you may have previously not known about and to support a wide range of causes.

# How Does This Application Work?

The application displays three blocks each providing information about a specific fundraiser.

If a fundraiser has a counter of current funds and a specific target, the application also displays a progress bar showing how close the fundraiser is to reaching its goal.

Click on the 'Visit website' button at the bottom of a block and you should be redirected to the website of the chosen fundraiser.

# How Many Fundraisers Does the Application Support?

As of right now, the application pulls data from 21 fundraisers.

# What Fundraisers Are Included?

The application includes both lethal (military support including weapons) and non-lethal (civilian support) fundraisers. Please carefully read the description for each fundraiser to make sure you are donating to the cause that you personally believe in.

# Can I Improve This Application?

Yes, the application is completely open source. You can add more fundraisers (just make sure that they are legit first) or optimize my code.

# Known Issues

Here are some problems you may encounter when using this application.

* Slow execution. I am not a professional .NET developer (yet) and my code is not really optimized.
* A lack of up-to-date data. As fundraisers reach their targets, they should no longer be displayed. However, I cannot guarantee that I will have enough time to remove them.

# Who Has Developed This Application?

This application was developed by me, a Tatar desperately wishing for the collapse of Russian imperialism. 

# What Do I Do If I Do Not Support This Application?

If you do not support Ukraine, kindly rethink your life choices.
